	<h1>Hermann Hesse</h1>
	<p class="first">
	<b>Hermann Hesse</b> (1877-1962), German poet and novelist, conveys through his works the duality of spirit and nature, body versus mind and the individual's spritual search outside the restrictions of the scoiety. Hesse was awarded the Noble prize for Literature in 1946.	
	</p>

	<p>
		Hesse was born in 1877 in Calw, germany on July 2, 1877. His parents expected him to follow the family tradition of following theology, so he entered the Protestant seminary at Maulbronn in 1891. But he was expelled from the school. After unhappy experiences at a secular school. hesse took up several jobs.
	</p>

	<p>
		In 1899, Hesse published his first works, <em>Romantische Lieder</em> and <em>Eine Stunde hinter Mitternacht</em> and became a freelance writer in 1904, when his novel <em>peter Camenzind</em> won literary success. The book reflected hesse's disgust with the educational system. In the same year, he married Maria bernoulli, with whome he had three chindren. A visit to India in 1911 drew him to study of Eastern religious and culminated in the novel <em>Siddhartha</em> (1922). It was based on the early life of the Gautama Buddha. The culture of ancient Hindus and Chinese had a significant impact on his works.
	</p>

	<p>
		Hesse spent the years of World War I in Switzerland, attacking the preventing tendency towards militarism and nationalism. In his novel, <em>Demian</em> (1919), he tells a Faustian tale of a man torn between his orderly bourgeois existence and a chaotic world of sensaulity. 
	</p>

	<p>
		He left his family in 1919 and moved to Montagnola, in southern Switzerland. He married second time to Ruth Wenger (1924-27) but it was an unhappy marriage. There difficult years led him to pen down <em>Der Steppenwolf</em> (1927). In 1931, he married his third wife, Ninon Dolbin, and the same year wrote his masterpiece, <em>Das Glasperlenspiel</em>, which was published in 1943. In 1942, he had sent the manuscript to Berlin for publication but it was not accepted by the Nazis. The work appeared for the first time in Zurich. Hesse's other central works include, <em>In Sight of Chaos</em> (1923), a collection of essays, the novel <em>Narcissus and Goldmund</em> (1930) and <em>Poems</em>(1970).
	</p>

	<p>
