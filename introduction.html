	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p class="first">
		<em>Siddhartha</em> is a novel by Herman Hesse dealing with the spritual journey of an Indian named Siddhartha during the time of the Buddha.
	</p>

	<p>
		The book, Hesse's ninth novel (1922), was written in German, in a simple, powerful and lyrical style. It was published in the U.S. in 1951 and became popular during the 1960's. Hesse dedicated <em>Siddhartha</em> to his wife <em>Meiner Frau Ninon Gewidmet</em> and supossedly afterwards to Romain Rolland and Wilhelm Gundert.
	</p>

	<p>
		The word <em>Siddhartha</em> is made up of two words in the Sanskrit language, <em>siddha</em> (achieved) + <em>artha</em> (meaning), which together means 'he who has found meaning (of existence)' or 'he who has attained his goals'. The Buddha's name, before his renunciation, was Prince Siddhartha Gautama. He was Prince of Kapilavastu, Nepal. In this book, the Buddha is referred to as 'Gotama'.
	</p>

	<p>
		The story takes place in ancient India around the time of Gautama Buddha. Siddhartha, the son of a Brahmin, leaves his home to join the ascetics with his companion Govinda. The two set out in search of enlightenment. Siddhartha takes to asceticism, after renouncing a worldly life of having a lover and living the life of a merchant in order to achieve his goal.
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>Experience</em> is the aggregate of conscious events experienced by a human in life - it connotes participation, learning and knowledge.
		<em>Understanding</em> is comprehension and internalization. Hesse's crafting of Siddhartha's journey shows that understanding is attained not through scholastic, mind dependent methods, nor through immersing oneself in the carnal pleasures of the world and the accompaying pain of <em>samsara</em>; however, it is the totality of these experiences that helps Siddhartha to attain understanding.
	</p>

	<p>
		Thus, the individual events are meaningless when considered by themselves - Siddhartha's stay with the Samanas and his immersion in the world of love and business did not lead to <em>nirvana</em>, yet they cannot be considered distractions, for every action and event, that is undertaken or occurs, helps Siddhartha termed as to achieve understanding. The sum of these events is thus <em>experience</em>.
